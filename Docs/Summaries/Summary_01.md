# Summary #1 — Core Setup and Character System

## Overview
Initial setup of the project structure, modular character system, and spawning logic.

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented **CharacterDefinition** as a ScriptableObject for storing character stats.  
- Built **RuntimeCharacter** to dynamically apply these definitions.  
- Added **CharacterSpawner** for instantiating randomized AI fighters.  
- Ensured modular design following SOLID principles.  

## Learning Outcomes
- Understood ScriptableObjects and their data-driven role.  
- Learned component communication and prefab instantiation.  
- Practiced randomization and procedural setup in Unity.
